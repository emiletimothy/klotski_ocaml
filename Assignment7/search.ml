  Create a new Storage structure (using S.create).
  Create a history which is just a list containing the initial board. Push it onto the storage structure.
  Create an empty set of visited boards (using DS.empty).
  Repeat the following steps:
  If the storage structure is empty, the search has failed, so raise the Not_found exception.
  Otherwise, pop a history off the storage structure. Then:
  Check the most recent board in the history. If it has already been seen (use the set of visited boards to check for this), throw the history away and go to the next one.
  Otherwise, check to see if the board solves the problem. If so, return the history and youâ€™re done!
  Otherwise, add the board to the set of visited boards, find the children of the current board (using the D.next function, which will actually be the next function you wrote in part A), generate the new histories, and push them back onto the storage structure. Then continue.
